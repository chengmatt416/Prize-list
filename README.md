## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Storage**: Vercel KV (Redis) with file-based fallback for development
- **Deployment**: Vercel-optimized

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chengmatt416/Prize-list.git
cd Prize-list
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Environment Setup

The application uses Vercel KV for production storage and falls back to file-based storage for local development.

#### Local Development
No environment variables are required for local development. The app will automatically use file-based storage in the `data/` directory.

#### Production Deployment on Vercel
1. Create a new KV database in your Vercel dashboard
2. The environment variables (`KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`) will be automatically set
3. Deploy your application - it will automatically use the KV storage

You can copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` if you want to test with KV storage locally.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## üåê Deployment on Vercel

This app is optimized for Vercel deployment with Vercel KV storage:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Create a new KV database in your Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy with zero configuration needed

The KV environment variables will be automatically configured by Vercel when you add a KV store to your project.

### Storage Architecture

- **Production**: Uses Vercel KV (Redis-based) for reliable, scalable storage
- **Development**: Falls back to local file-based storage for easy development
- **Automatic Detection**: The app automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate storage method

## üìä API Endpoints

### Prizes

- `POST /api/prizes` - Create a new prize
- `GET /api/prizes/[id]` - Get a specific prize

## üîß Customization

The app uses a purple gradient theme that can be easily customized by modifying the Tailwind classes in the components. The color scheme uses:
- Primary: Purple gradients (`from-purple-900 via-blue-900 to-indigo-900`)
- Accent: Purple (`purple-600`, `purple-700`)
- Success: Green (`green-500`, `green-600`)
- Warning: Yellow (`yellow-400`, `yellow-300`)
